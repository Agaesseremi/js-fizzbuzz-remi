# FizzBuzz

* `Fork` the GitHub repository
* `git add`, `git commit` and` git push` directly on your repository as much you want.
* Open an `Pull request`, you must get a green light on the Travis CI server to validate the exercise!

## Rules :

* print out "Fizz" if the integer is a multiple of 3
* print out "Buzz" if the integer is a multiple of 5
* print "FizzBuzz" if the integer is a multiple of 3 and 5

## GO, GO, GO!

May the force be with you
